Exploratory Data Analysis
In this Instacart EDA project, I will analyze a dataset from Instacart, a popular grocery delivery platform. The dataset, based on the 2017 Kaggle competition, has been modified for the project. My mission is to clean and preprocess the data, address missing and duplicate values, and provide valuable insights into Instacart customers' shopping habits.

The dataset modifications aim to enhance processing speed while maintaining the original data's distributions. After tackling data preprocessing, I will explore various aspects, answering questions that delve into customer behavior. Each question will be followed by concise explanations of my findings, creating a comprehensive report on Instacart shopping trends.
